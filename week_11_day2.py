# Day 2 Review Activity: My Personal Info Generator
# ----------------------------------------

print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Joshua"
age = 17
favorite_color = "purple"
favorite_number = 4
result = age + favorite_number
#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print("Uppercase:", first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name

print("Length of name:", len(first_name))
# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message


#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print("Your age plus your favorite number is", result)

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
food = print(input("What is your favorite food:"))
dressing = print(input("What is your favorite dressing:"))

print(dressing, food))
# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
